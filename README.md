## 🎯 What This Project Is About

Most ML tutorials teach you to train a model and celebrate high accuracy. This project teaches you to **question that accuracy**.

I used the Titanic dataset to demonstrate 4 statistical concepts that every ML practitioner must understand:

| Concept | What It Answers |
|---------|----------------|
| **Bias-Variance Tradeoff** | Is my model too simple or too complex? |
| **Cross-Validation** | Can I trust this accuracy score? |
| **Confidence Intervals** | How uncertain am I about performance? |
| **Hypothesis Testing** | Is this improvement real or just luck? |
